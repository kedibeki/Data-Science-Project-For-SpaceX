<h2>
Project background and context
</h2>

 <h4>
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. This goal of the project is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land successfully.

<h2>
Problems I'm going to solve as a Data Scientist
</h2>

 <h4>
 
1. What factors determine if the rocket will land successfully?

2. Determinr the interaction among various features that determine the success rate of a successful landing?

3. What operating conditions needs to be in place to ensure a successful landing program?
